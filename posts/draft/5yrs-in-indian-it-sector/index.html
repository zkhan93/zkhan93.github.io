<p>After schooling I was not sure what to do next, My dear friend Rohit told me to take this exam called AIEEE and IIT-JEE, yes I didn&rsquo;t know what were these, and so I didn&rsquo;t clear it, dropped for a year to prepare still same result, My elder brother told me to take admission in the nearby college affiliated to state university.</p>

<p>I choose B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering, first year seems like a Déjà vu similar subjects from schooling, however I realized I was good in Chemistry and Mechanics, like always I wasn&rsquo;t able to score much but I think I can say I was doing above average.
In subsequent years the computer science subjects came and man! they came in hot. Few of them that I remember were Computer Systems, Digital Logic Design, Data Structures, Graph Theory, etc. I was able to grasp these partially, enough to clear the exams, some of these were made easy for me by few good faculties we had.</p>

<p>Thinking back, now I realize it was funny how less we actually interacted with computers despite being in a CSE student.</p>
<p>Luckily my parent got me a desktop system and I started to code in C and Java on my own, Internet was not readily available in my city back then, somehow I managed to get a internet connection, The internet opened my eye, it was filled with information about technologies and languages and I was struggling to compile my 10 lines of code, I felt outdated already.</p>
<p>I was clearly missing out on guidance, while seeking that I got to know about competitive programming, I started solving some basic problems on CodeChef, it gave me some confidence and sense of why I should be optimizing my code, I could feel a small knowledge graph being build up in my mind with the practical knowledge from theory classes.</p>

<p>I got my first Android phone, it was an Sony Xperia Mini
REST and Android was a new thing that I learned about, so I decided to take my final college project seriously and create an Android application for our college the idea presented was that faculties and students will be able to log in, chat and share docs, It was a team project so I had a partner to work with she was very smart and helped a lot in completing the project, the document sharing feature was dropped since it was too much for us.
