I was an average student during my schooling. I somehow managed to survive long enough to get introduced to computer science subject in 11th, the subject was to teach C programming language, at first my mind start asking too many question, I told some of them to my teacher on which she said "Just accept what is being told this is the basic information that you will need to start thinking in C", I absorbed few initial chapters and it started making sense once we got started with coding, I learnt few things, it started to feel like a super power I had, I can ask a computer to do something for me :), I was happy and eager to learn more but then session got over.

After schooling I was not sure what to do next, My dear friend Rohit told me to take this exam called AIEEE and IIT-JEE, yes I didn't know what were these, and so I didn't clear it, dropped for a year to prepare still same result, My elder brother told me to take admission in the nearby college affiliated to state university.

### Engineering
I choose B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering, first year seems like a Déjà vu similar subjects from schooling, however I realized I was good in Chemistry and Mechanics, like always I wasn't able to score much but I think I can say I was doing above average. 
In subsequent years the computer science subjects came and man! they came in hot. Few of them that I remember were Computer Systems, Digital Logic Design, Data Structures, Graph Theory, etc. I was able to grasp these partially, enough to clear the exams, some of these were made easy for me by few good faculties we had.

We had practical for some subjects like Data Structures, so in lab we were suppose to write a program that was taught in the class then try to execute it, In the lab I would write my program and try to compile it, most of the time when there are errors in compilation the error messages were making sense to me, but some of my friends were struggling to fix theirs then they will give up and ask others to fix it.

Thinking back, now I realize it was funny how less we actually interacted with computers despite being in a CSE student.

Luckily my parent got me a desktop system and I started to code in C and Java on my own, Internet was not readily available in my city back then, somehow I managed to get a internet connection, The internet opened my eye, it was filled with information about technologies and languages and I was struggling to compile my 10 lines of code, I felt outdated already.

I was clearly missing out on guidance, while seeking that I got to know about competitive programming, I started solving some basic problems on CodeChef, it gave me some confidence and sense of why I should be optimizing my code, I could feel a small knowledge graph being build up in my mind with the practical knowledge from theory classes.

My curiosity to build things helped me and I built few Java applications, one of them was a game called "sink the ship" I used Java Swing to build it, I wrote 10000 lines of C code to create a k-map solver, it was working of all the tests we could think of, but it was basically a lot of `if` conditions.

I got my first Android phone, it was an Sony Xperia Mini
REST and Android was a new thing that I learned about, so I decided to take my final college project seriously and create an Android application for our college the idea presented was that faculties and students will be able to log in, chat and share docs, It was a team project so I had a partner to work with she was very smart and helped a lot in completing the project, the document sharing feature was dropped since it was too much for us.
The project submissions were evaluated by external faculty, I'm not sure how much I was able to explain to him, but he really didn't care if it ran, he asked few questions so that he can rate us and later assign marks to that ratings.

The end of college life was near, it was time to start looking for jobs.
Some companies came they had screening round which were basically math and quants questions, I was not able to clear few them, others I got rejected in interview mainly because I was not very good at communicating and the rest of them wanted to hear the exact answers they think was right. overall result was I didn't get selected in campus placements.
It was not a great feeling, but after few weeks TCS came to a nearby college and they were accepting candidates from other colleges also, I though this is my last chance to get a job, I prepared by what ever I could, after few online/offline test and multiple rounds of interview I got selected in TCS. I was happy.
