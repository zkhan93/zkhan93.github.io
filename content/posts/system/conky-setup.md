I use ubuntu as my daily driver so all the commands are going to be ubuntu/debian based
### Installation
Install conky-all package by `sudo apt-get install conky-all`

### Setup
conky takes a config file to know what to draw on screen.
the default location of config file is `~/.conkyrc`

### Run
you can start the conky by just typing `conky` in terminal, and a and ugly black window should come up.

### Customization
There are thousands of options to pick conky config, and if that's not enough you can just google for more.
I'll add a link to my favorites one here, 
[Conky Orange](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1115398/) its 11 years old still looks decent

you can search for more on [gnome-look](https://www.gnome-look.org/browse?cat=124&ord=latest) or [deviantart](https://www.deviantart.com/tag/conky)

### My Customizations I have 
I have 3 conky configs 
 - system monitor
 - quotes from github
 - parcel tracking
